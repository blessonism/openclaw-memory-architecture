# YYYY-MM-DD (Day)

- Commands run / results

## [Topic 2]

<!-- 
Daily log guidelines:
- Write as events happen, not as a summary at the end
- Include enough detail that a review process can extract knowledge later
- Record decisions with "why", not just "what"
- Include file paths, command outputs, error messages — specifics matter
- This is raw material for the knowledge pipeline
