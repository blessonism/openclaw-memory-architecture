# Post-Mortems / Lessons Learned

Learn from mistakes. Don't repeat them.

## [Short Title] (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Scenario:** What were you trying to do?
**Problem:** What went wrong?
**Root cause:** Why did it go wrong?
**Fix:** What's the correct approach going forward?
**Lesson:** What general principle does this teach?

<!--
Guidelines:
- Write immediately when the problem is fresh
- Be specific: include error messages, file paths, exact commands
- Focus on root cause, not symptoms
- The "lesson" should be a reusable principle, not just "don't do X"
- When the same failure type appears 3+ times, graduate it to knowledge/pat-*.md
